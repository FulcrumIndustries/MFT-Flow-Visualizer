remove pdf system entirely -> instead add a button on each flow to generate a png and copy it in cache with the flow diagram + comments & text fields. The idea is to let the user paste it in powerpoint for example.
source to intermediate with multiple arrows doesn't save comments/texts properly, also only 1 comment pair instead of 2 when compared to the double target system we added
